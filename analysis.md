# 📊 Credit Score Analysis of Wallets (Aave V2 Protocol)

This document presents an analysis of the credit scores assigned to user wallets based on their historical DeFi transaction behavior on the Aave V2 protocol.

## 🎯 Objective

We aimed to generate a credit score between **0 and 1000** for each wallet using features like:
- Number of borrows/repays/liquidations
- Repayment ratio
- Deposit behavior
- Active days and transaction recency
- Most used and unique assets

A higher score indicates a more responsible and reliable DeFi user.
