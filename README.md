# Aave Wallet Credit Scoring

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to score DeFi user wallets based on transaction history from the Aave protocol. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and score prediction.

##  Project Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction
- The zipped file `user-wallet-transactions.json.zip` is unzipped.
- JSON transaction data is loaded and flattened into a structured pandas DataFrame.
- Data is stored as `df.pkl`.

### 2. Feature Engineering
Wallet-level features are computed, including:
- **Transaction Counts**: deposits, borrows, repays, redeems, liquidations
- **USD Values**: total deposit, borrow, repay, redeem amounts
- **Ratios**: borrow-to-repay, repay percentage, liquidation ratio, deposit-to-borrow, etc.
- **Time Features**: first and last transaction, days active, days since last transaction
- **Activity**: average and standard deviation of transaction values
- **Most Used Asset** and **Unique Asset Count**

The final wallet-level DataFrame is saved as `wallet_features.pkl`.

### 3. Credit Score Calculation
A synthetic credit score is generated for each wallet using a weighted formula:
credit_score =
(repaid_percentage.clip(0, 1.2) * 400) +
((1 - liquidation_ratio.clip(0, 1)) * 200) +
(redeem_to_deposit_ratio.clip(0, 1.5) * 150) +
(active_days / max(active_days) * 100) +
(1 / (1 + days_since_last_tx) * 150)


The score is clipped to fall between 0 and 1000.

### 4. Model Training (XGBoost)
- An XGBoost regression model is trained on the wallet features to predict the credit score.
- Model metrics:
  - R¬≤ score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - 5-fold cross-validated MSE

The model is used to predict scores for all wallets.

### 5. Output
- Final output file: `wallet_score_output.csv`  
  (contains: `userWallet`, `predicted_score`)
- Visuals:
  - True vs. Predicted Score Scatter Plot
  - Score Distribution Bar Plot (0‚Äì1000 buckets)

## üîç Score Analysis

### Score Buckets:
Wallets are grouped into buckets based on predicted scores:

| Score Range | Wallet Behavior Summary |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| 0‚Äì200       | Poor repayment, frequent liquidations, low activity |
| 200‚Äì500     | Moderate borrowing with occasional liquidations |
| 500‚Äì800     | Balanced activity and healthy repayment behavior |
| 800‚Äì1000    | High repayment %, low risk, frequent redemptions |
